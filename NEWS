harvestr is a package that facilitates the creation
of reproducible parallel simulations.  

The primary functions are:

  * `farm` for generating datasets from the paralele seeds.
  * `harvest` for applying an analysis function for each generated data frame,
    including stochastic analysis such as bootstrap or mcmc.
